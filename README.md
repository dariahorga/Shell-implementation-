# Shell Implementation Project

## General Context
This project entails the implementation of a simple shell in the C programming language. The purpose of this shell is to act as an interface between the user and the operating system, enabling them to interact by entering commands.

## Objectives
1. Efficient execution of simple commands (e.g., ls, cd).
2. Execution of more advanced commands (pipes).
3. User support to aid understanding of the shell's functionality and available commands.
4. Basic commands: Implementation of simple file and directory manipulation commands (delete, copy, create).
5. Terminal clearing: Provides a command to clear the terminal screen.
6. Redirection: Execution of external commands and redirection of input and output as needed.
7. Pipes: Execution of multiple commands in succession by creating communication channels.
8. History: Implementation of the history command to display previous commands.
9. Help function: Provides a list of available commands in the shell.
10. Proper command handling: Reading from standard input, parsing command strings, and executing commands.
11. UX/UI Design: User interaction with the terminal.
